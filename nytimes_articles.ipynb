He’s a captain for Delta Air Lines and has just opened another Yemen Café. While achieving his dream of becoming a pilot, he went into the restaurant business with his father and uncle. He still flies, weaving his schedule  with his restaurant duties. His father, Muthamma Nassir, was a chef at Windows on the World and opened the original Yemen Café in 1986 with a relative, Yahya Alsubai, on the stretch of Atlantic Avenue bordering Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood clustered with Middle Eastern restaurants and shops. Akram Nassir says it was the first Yemeni restaurant in New York, if not the United States. In 2011, he opened another in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Now, he and his partner, Mr. Alsubai, have branched out to Staten Island. There, they will again serve a Middle Eastern community, he said. The latest Yemen Café, a spacious room with a traditional fishing boat hanging on one wall, has outdoor seating. As at the other locations, the specialty is lamb more than a dozen ways, notably slow-cooked, succulent falling-off-the-bone cuts like shanks and shoulder. There are also chicken dishes and Middle Eastern appetizers. ',\n",

Voiced by Chloë Grace Moretz, the title character busts into a futuristic world where knights defend the castle and the powerful might not be as benevolent as they’d like the citizens to believe. Based on a best-selling graphic novel by ND Stevenson and directed by Nick Bruno and Troy Quane (who also co-directed “Spies in Disguise”), this 2023 animated feature from Netflix gives young children a mile-a-minute main character who slides between “good guy” and “bad guy” status, defying the usual stereotypes. Stevenson has called the story a transgender allegory, and the L.G.B.T.Q. representation is a welcome change from the usual kids’ movie universes, where knights fall in love with princesses, not with each other. Here, Riz Ahmed voices Ballister Boldheart, a knight who has been wrongly accused of murdering Queen Valerin (Lorraine Toussaint). Ballister reluctantly allows Nimona to help him take down a corrupt system, prove his innocence and reunite with his partner, Ambrosius Goldenloin (Eugene Lee Yang). As a character, Nimona has zero chill and might prove a little tough for adults to watch for any length of time, but my son was entertained by the character’s constant motion, chaotic energy and what-will-come-next transformations.',\n",

John Derian, a designer known for his table wares and decorative accessories done with decoupage under glass, makes oval serving platters decorated with ears of yellow and red corn, 10 by 14 inches, $150. They must only be wiped clean, not immersed in water. Each is handmade; if not in stock, they require two to four weeks to deliver. Another summer option is his watermelon platter, made from glazed terra-cotta that is dishwasher-safe. Paper Trail, in Rhinebeck, N.Y., carries the corn plates, $150 each. They can also be ordered from Mr. Derian’s studio, $155 for the corn, $260 for watermelon.',\n",

       "  'lead_paragraph': 'These days, it seems that some restaurants will add a dollop of caviar to anything, from fried chicken to hamburgers, practically reducing the once-luxurious treat to a condiment. So it’s perhaps no surprise that chefs are turning their attention to something more rarefied than your everyday osetra: albino caviar, which ranges in color from alabaster to golden, and is the result of uncommon mutations. The most sought after is that of the beluga sturgeon but, says Hermes Gehnen, the founder of N25 Caviar, an international purveyor, “restaurants generally can’t afford it. It’s more for superyachts.” At Les Trois Chevaux in New York, the eggs of the Acipenser ruthenus, a small sturgeon known as the sterlet, are shaped into a quenelle tableside and plated with white asparagus, aerated béchamel and beurre de baratte-basted brioche. The monochromatic presentation allows diners to be “more cognizant of what [they’re] actually tasting,” says the restaurant’s owner, Angie Mar, 41, who describes albino caviar as “supple and velvety.” Rasmus Munk, 32, the chef and co-owner of Alchemist in Copenhagen, is drawn to albino caviar’s “beautiful aroma of butter and creamy texture.” He serves it atop a square of crisp, sourdough-flavored freeze-dried milk born of his collaboration with an M.I.T. researcher on food for space travel. And at the omakase restaurant the Araki in London, the chef Marty Lau slices white cuttlefish and squid into fine ribbons and tops them with a spoonful of golden roe. Although white caviar stock is limited, they aren’t the only pale orbs worth chasing. Snail eggs, which have a mushroomlike flavor, have the same visual appeal despite their earthy taste. Just don’t assume they’ll be a bargain. “Sometimes,” says Munk, “you’ll pay even more money for snail eggs than you do for caviar.” — Lauren Joseph',\n",

In addition to cooking for millions in disaster areas and writing several cookbooks, Mr. Andrés has found the time to research the 17th-century voyage of Hasekura Tsunenaga, a noble samurai considered the first Japanese ambassador to Spain and the Americas (he even visited the Vatican). He has inspired Mr. Andrés; Koji Terano, the head chef of research and development; Manuel Echeverri, Mr. Andrés’s culinary director for the various Bazaars; and Victor Rivera, the executive chef in New York, to marry Spanish fare with Japanese preparations. The menu has sections labeled fry/tempura with ham croquetas, chicken karaage and red mullet tempura. Plancha/teppan includes baby squid and crispy socarrat, and josper/robata features short rib and piquillos, honey-miso eggplant and grilled marinated carabinero prawns with Japanese condiments. “It’s a play on the various concepts that are similar,” Mr. Echeverri said. “Raw Bar, Crudos, Sashimi, Same Thing” is a grouping of mostly raw fish preparations. Small bites come under the heading of little starters. The colorful dining room, exuberantly decorated with huge chandeliers and seafaring accents, seats more than 100. On the ground floor, Bazaar Bar serves drinks, including sakes, and small bites. Lázaro Rosa-Violán Studio in Spain designed both areas.',\n",
